    <p>
      I'm Kenneth Quintero. I live in Baja California Sur, Mexico with my family
      and my 3 dogs. I started coding in 2018 when I have to choose a career
      path. Altough it was a last minute decision, I found out that I really
      enjoyed this field and I've been learning and coding ever since.

          Beyond coding, I like 3D printing things, occasionally playing with my
          guitar, reading manga (though I haven't been reading as much lately),
          and playing video games with friends. I'm also a big fan of sci-fi and
          horror movies. It's funny because, as a kid, they used to terrify me.
          Now, I really like diving into the lore, monsters, and stories behind
          them.

        <p>
          But for the most part, I'm finding new things I can create through
          code.

          I get anxious when I can’t understand how something works, so I’m
          constantly learning, figuring out how things operate, and exploring
          ways to apply that knowledge to other areas.

      I think the reason I like programming is because you have to understand
      what you’re doing to make it work. And I really like that. It’s like
      solving a puzzle, building something from scratch, and seeing it come to
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I like the most, is that it is the real life version of magic.
      You can create something out of nothing, and make it work the way you want
      it to. The language you use is like the spell you cast, and the computer
      is the magic wand. And the best part is that you can share your magic with
      the world instantly.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-primary">Why do I blog?</h2>
    <p>
      I blog primarily to document what I’m learning and the projects I’m
      working on. So I can have a space where I can track my progress, gain new
      insights, and hopefully get new ideas, all of this while improving my
      writing and communication skills.
