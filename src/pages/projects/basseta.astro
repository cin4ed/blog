          Basseta is a web-based audio editor that brings the power of
          node-based audio processing to your browser. Currently in early development,
          this closed-source project is designed with both beginners and professionals
          in mind, providing an intuitive visual interface for creating and manipulating
          audio effects chains without requiring deep technical knowledge of audio
          processing.

          Built with TypeScript and React, Basseta leverages the Web Audio API
          to provide real-time audio processing capabilities. The application
          uses a custom node-based UI framework built on top of React Flow,
          while Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent and responsive design. The
          audio processing engine is built with performance in mind, utilizing
          Web Workers for heavy computations and the Web Audio API's native
          processing capabilities.

        <div class="space-y-4 text-[1.2rem]">
          <p>
            Basseta was born from the need for a more accessible way to create
            and experiment with audio effects. The project started as a simple
            audio processing tool and evolved into a full-featured node-based
            editor. Special attention was paid to making the interface intuitive
            while maintaining powerful capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development process focused on creating a robust foundation that
            could support complex audio processing chains while remaining
            performant. Key challenges included managing real-time audio
            processing, implementing a flexible node system, and ensuring smooth
            user interactions.
