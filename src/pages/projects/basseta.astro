      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Basseta is a visual node-based audio editor that makes audio processing
        accessible to everyone. It's a web-based tool that lets you create
        complex audio effects chains by connecting nodes together – no deep
        technical knowledge required. Just drag, drop, and connect nodes to
        build your sound. Currently in early development, this closed-source
        project aims to bring powerful audio processing to your browser.

      <h2>Nerd Notes</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Built with TypeScript and React, leveraging the Web Audio API for
        real-time audio processing. I used React Flow as the foundation for the
        node system, which was super fun to customize. The biggest challenge?
        Making sure audio processing stays performant even with complex chains –
        ended up using Web Workers for the heavy lifting. It's still early days,
        but I'm stoked about making audio processing more visual and intuitive.
        Give it a try if you're into sound design!
