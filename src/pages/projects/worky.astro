      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Worky is a macOS menu bar tool that keeps your desktop organized and
        clutter-free. It lets you create workspaces (groups of related files)
        and switch between them as needed. And when you want a distraction-free
        environment, Worky clears your desktop and safely stores everything for
        quick access later.

      <h2>Nerd Notes</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        With worky, keeping the app state sane was a massive pain in the ass,
        that it almost made me give up on this one, but neveeer!!!!. Tracking
        workspaces, serializing/deserializing them reliably, and especially
        dealing with all the chaos when users mess with their folders outside
        the app (or while it’s closed) meant hunting down a ton of nasty edge
        cases and building a proper little state machine under the hood. Gotta
        say – I’m pretty damn proud of this bad boy ;) If you get a chance,
        check it out!
