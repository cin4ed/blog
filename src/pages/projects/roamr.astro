      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Roamr is a community-driven platform for urban explorers to discover and
        share abandoned places around the world. It features an interactive map
        interface where users can find forgotten locations, read their
        histories, and contribute their own discoveries. The platform emphasizes
        safety and responsible exploration while preserving the stories of these
        abandoned spaces.

      <h2>Nerd Notes</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Built this with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. The mapping is
        powered by MapLibre and OpenStreetMap, which was a blast to work with.
        The trickiest part was handling location data responsibly – balancing
        accessibility with privacy concerns for sensitive locations. Currently
        working on the community features like ratings and photo galleries. It's
        still a work in progress, but I'm excited about where it's headed!
