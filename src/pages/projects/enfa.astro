      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Enfá is a food delivery app I made for my town. It allows you to order
        food from local restaurants and have it delivered to your door.

      <h2>Nerd Notes</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 font-extralight">
        Enfá comes from "En fá" which means "to make it fast", it´s
        spanish-english slang that has something to do with the word "fast", any
        way. I built this app because I was tired of my mom sending me to get
        her ceviche from the local restaurant, and also because my town is too
        small that major delivery apps wouldn't cover it.
