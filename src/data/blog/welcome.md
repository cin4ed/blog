Hi there! I'm Kenneth, a recently graduated software engineer, and this is my blog. I'm
not sure what I'll use it for yet, but I'll figure it out as I go along, that's the fun
part of it.

I'm currently working on a few projects, and I'll be sharing my learnings here. Also if
you find any errors or typos, please let me know (I'm not a native English speaker).

See you around!
